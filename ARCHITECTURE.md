# 🚀 Milestone #1 — Core Engine Render Validation (Completed)

Date: 28 Feb 2026

Status: ✅ SUCCESS

What was validated:

- Remotion CLI installed correctly
- Dependencies configured
- Static asset resolution working via staticFile()
- Html5Audio functioning
- Headless rendering via CLI working
- MP4 output successfully generated
- Public folder asset mapping confirmed
- Engine render pipeline verified end-to-end

Pipeline validated:

JSX → Bundle → Headless Chrome → Static Assets → Audio → Encoding → MP4

This confirms the foundational rendering system is operational.

Next Phase: Multi-scene dynamic architecture.

# 🚀 Milestone #2 — Dynamic Multi-Scene Architecture (Completed)

Date: 28 Feb 2026

Status: ✅ SUCCESS

What was achieved:

- JSON-driven scene rendering
- SceneManager sequencing via <Sequence>
- SceneBlock abstraction layer
- Html5Audio integration per scene
- Python-controlled CLI rendering
- Output stored in /output

Pipeline validated:

JSON → SceneManager → SceneBlock → Audio → Python → MP4

Engine now supports scalable multi-scene video production.
