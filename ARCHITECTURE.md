Status: ✅ SUCCESS

What was validated:

- Remotion CLI installed correctly
- Dependencies configured
- Static asset resolution working via staticFile()
- Html5Audio functioning
- Headless rendering via CLI working
- MP4 output successfully generated
- Public folder asset mapping confirmed
- Engine render pipeline verified end-to-end

Pipeline validated:

JSX → Bundle → Headless Chrome → Static Assets → Audio → Encoding → MP4

This confirms the foundational rendering system is operational.
