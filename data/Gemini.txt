Automated Video Generation From Code
Conversation with Gemini

Explain what it is trying to do

Gemini said
You are building a fully automated, programmatic video production factory to run a scalable YouTube business. Instead of manually animating and editing videos one by one in software like Premiere Pro or After Effects, you are trying to write code that generates the videos for you.

Here is the exact breakdown of what this system is trying to accomplish:

1. The Video Engine (Remotion & Node.js)
You are using Remotion, which is a framework that allows you to create animations using web technologies (React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript). This acts as the "artist" of your factory. It handles:

High-quality 2D vector graphics and cinematic camera movements.

Programmatic scenes, such as crowds protesting, smooth transitions, and motion blur.

Exporting the final code-driven visuals into 2K MP4 videos or vertical Shorts.
+1

2. The Automation Brain (Python)
Since you don't want to manually edit React code for every single video, you are setting up Python to act as the "manager". The Python script (manager.py or pipeline.py) is designed to:

Read external data (like video titles and themes).

Format that data into a json file.

Trigger the Remotion engine via your command line to start rendering the video based on that specific data.

3. The Fuel (Topics.txt)
This file contains 500 highly clickable, educational, and social commentary video ideas divided into themes like "Everyday Life Systems," "Money & Economic Systems," and "Power & Governance Systems". This is the raw material for your factory.
+2

The Ultimate Goal
You are trying to connect all these pieces together so that your Python script can grab a topic from your 500-item list (e.g., "Why Is Rent So High Everywhere?" ), inject that text into your pre-designed Remotion template, and automatically export a finished, professional-grade YouTube video. Once the pipeline is fully built, you will be able to batch-render hundreds of videos just by pressing "run" on your Python script.
+2

Would you like me to help you write the specific Python script that reads from your Topics.txt file and feeds those titles directly into your Remotion rendering queue?

You said
What are the requirements for the laptop's system information, installed softwares informations, hardware information, installed softwares and their packages information, installed packages inside installed softwares, languages and all their versions you will require to build the system that generates one video at a time? Tell me how will I be able to provide you these information using command prompt?

Gemini said
It is incredibly smart to map out your entire system architecture before writing the final production code. Knowing exactly what is running on your machine prevents version conflicts and rendering failures later on.

Your current setup with Windows 11, a Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 2GB GPU, and a 256GB SSD is already well-suited for generating high-quality 1080p and 2K videos one at a time.
+2

Here is the exact breakdown of the system requirements needed for your automated video factory, followed by the commands to extract your current configuration.

System & Hardware Requirements

OS: Windows 11 (Standard environment for your workflow).
+1


CPU: Multi-core processor (Ryzen 5 handles frame processing efficiently).
+1


RAM: 16GB minimum (Required for Remotion to compile React components and encode video without crashing).
+1


Storage: SSD (Fast read/write speeds are crucial for saving hundreds of rendered frames quickly).
+1

Software & Language Requirements

Node.js: The core engine that runs Remotion. Version 20 (LTS) or your current v24.14.0 is required.
+3


Python: The automation manager. Version 3.12 or higher is recommended (you are currently running 3.14.3).
+3


FFmpeg: The backend video exporter that Remotion uses to stitch frames into an MP4.


VS Code: The integrated development environment for managing both Python and React code simultaneously.
+1

Required Packages

Node/npm Packages: @remotion/cli, remotion, and @remotion/player (locked to version 4.0.429 for stability). Advanced visuals will require @remotion/motion-blur.
+4

Python Packages: No external pip packages are strictly required yet. The bridge relies entirely on Python's built-in standard libraries: json, os, and subprocess.
+2

How to Extract Your System Info via Command Prompt
To verify everything currently installed on your machine, open your Command Prompt (cmd) and run the following commands one by one. You can copy the output and provide it back to me.

1. Hardware & OS Information
To check your exact Windows version and total RAM:
systeminfo | findstr /C:"OS Name" /C:"Total Physical Memory"

To check your exact CPU model:
wmic cpu get name

2. Core Languages & Engines
To verify Node.js and npm versions:
node -v
npm -v

To verify Python and pip versions:
python --version
pip --version

To verify FFmpeg is installed and accessible in your system PATH:
ffmpeg -version

3. Installed Packages
To list all globally installed Node packages:
npm list -g --depth=0

To list all globally installed Python packages:
pip list

4. Project-Specific Remotion Packages
To see the exact Remotion packages installed inside your specific project, navigate to your project folder first:
cd "C:\Users\hkuma\Node.js_Animation\Studio_System"
npm list

Would you like to run these commands and paste the results here so we can confirm your environment is 100% ready for the cinematic template integration?

You said


C:\Users\hkuma>wmic cpu get name

'wmic' is not recognized as an internal or external command,

operable program or batch file.



C:\Users\hkuma>

Gemini said
Ah, good catch! You just ran into a modern Windows quirk. Microsoft recently deprecated and removed the wmic command from newer versions of Windows 11, which is why your system doesn't recognize it. Nothing is broken on your end.

Since you are setting up this YouTube animation factory on Windows 11, we can use a native alternative that works perfectly in your standard Command Prompt.

Let's grab all your system information using updated commands. Copy and paste these into your terminal one by one, and share the output with me:

1. Hardware & OS Information (Updated)
This single command will pull your OS version, RAM, and CPU details all at once:

DOS
systeminfo | findstr /C:"OS Name" /C:"Total Physical Memory" /C:"Processor"
2. Core Engines (Node, Python, FFmpeg)
Check your runtimes and video encoder:

DOS
node -v
DOS
npm -v
DOS
python --version
DOS
ffmpeg -version
(Note: For FFmpeg, we just need to see if it spits out a version number or gives an error).

3. Project-Specific Packages
To see exactly what Remotion packages are installed in the new cinematic engine we've been designing, navigate into your studio folder and list them:

DOS
cd "C:\Users\hkuma\Node.js_Animation\Studio_System"
DOS
npm list
Go ahead and run those, and paste the results back here. Would you like me to start writing the Python automation script (render_single.py) while you gather that info?

You said
Why did it show error, fix this:



C:\Users\hkuma>npm list -g --depth=0

npm error code ENOENT

npm error syscall lstat

npm error path C:\Users\hkuma\AppData\Roaming\npm

npm error errno -4058

npm error enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, lstat 'C:\Users\hkuma\AppData\Roaming\npm'

npm error enoent This is related to npm not being able to find a file.

npm error enoent

npm error A complete log of this run can be found in: C:\Users\hkuma\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_logs\2026-02-26T16_25_13_011Z-debug-0.log

Gemini said
This is a super common and slightly annoying Windows quirk with Node.js. Don't worry, your installation isn't broken!

Why This Error Happened
When you ran the command to check your globally installed packages, npm tried to look inside its default global folder: C:\Users\hkuma\AppData\Roaming\npm. Because you likely haven't installed any global packages yet, that folder was never actually created, so npm threw a "file not found" (ENOENT / Error code -4058) error.

How to Fix It
We just need to manually create that missing folder so npm stops panicking.

Open your Command Prompt.

Copy and paste this exact command to create the folder, then press Enter:

DOS
mkdir C:\Users\hkuma\AppData\Roaming\npm
Now, run your original command again:

DOS
npm list -g --depth=0
It should now run perfectly. It will probably just return an empty list or only show npm itself, which is exactly what we want to see.

Would you like to move on to the Python and FFmpeg checks next so we can finish verifying your video factory's foundation?

Gemini said
First off, excellent job pulling all of this information. Your system is perfectly primed for exactly what you want to do.

Here is the breakdown of your diagnostics:

Hardware: Windows 11 Pro with roughly 16GB of RAM is more than enough to handle 1080p and 2K vector rendering smoothly.

Software Engines: You have Node.js (v24.14.0), npm (v11.9.0), and Python (v3.14.3) all installed and up to date.

Video Encoder: FFmpeg (v8.0.1) is successfully installed and recognized by your system. This is usually the hardest step for beginners, and you nailed it.

Packages: Your test folder (Node_Test1) shows Remotion v4.0.429 is installed perfectly.

Do you need anything else? No. You have the exact software stack required to run a professional, code-driven animation studio.

I noticed the terminal returned The system cannot find the path specified when you tried to navigate to Studio_System. That simply means we haven't created your final production folder yet.

Let's set up your clean, one-video-at-a-time pipeline right now.

Step 1: Create Your Production Folder
Open your VS Code terminal and run these commands to create a fresh directory for your business:

DOS
cd C:\Users\hkuma\Node.js_Animation
mkdir Single_Video_System
cd Single_Video_System
Step 2: Initialize the Remotion Engine
Now, we create the "Artist" that will draw your frames:

DOS
npx create-video@latest engine
When prompted:

Choose Blank template.

Choose JavaScript.

Choose No for Tailwind and Agent skills.

If Git asks to continue, choose Yes.

Once that is done, move into the folder and install the necessary files:

DOS
cd engine
npm install
npm install @remotion/motion-blur
Step 3: Create the Animation Template
Inside VS Code, navigate to engine/src. Create a new file called ProtestVideo.jsx and paste this code:

JavaScript
import { AbsoluteFill, useCurrentFrame, interpolate } from "remotion";

export const ProtestVideo = ({ title, subtitle, theme }) => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();
  const fadeIn = interpolate(frame, [0, 30], [0, 1]);

  return (
    <AbsoluteFill
      style={{
        backgroundColor: theme || "#0f172a",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        flexDirection: "column",
        opacity: fadeIn
      }}
    >
      <h1 style={{ fontSize: 100, color: "white", fontWeight: "bold" }}>{title}</h1>
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: 60, color: "#94a3b8" }}>{subtitle}</h2>
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
Next, open engine/src/Root.jsx and replace everything inside with this:

JavaScript
import { Composition } from "remotion";
import { ProtestVideo } from "./ProtestVideo";

export const RemotionRoot = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Composition
        id="ProtestVideo"
        component={ProtestVideo}
        durationInFrames={300}
        fps={30}
        width={1920}
        height={1080}
        defaultProps={{
          title: "Default Title",
          subtitle: "Default Subtitle",
          theme: "#0f172a"
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
};
Save both files.

Step 4: The Python "Boss" Controller
Go back to your main Single_Video_System folder in the terminal:

DOS
cd ..
Create a new file named config.json and paste your video data into it:

JSON
{
  "title": "Why Is Rent So High Everywhere?",
  "subtitle": "The Economics of Housing",
  "theme": "#111827"
}
Finally, create a file named render.py. This is the Python manager that reads your configuration and commands the engine to render the video:

Python
import json
import subprocess
import os

# Create an output folder if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists('output'):
    os.makedirs('output')

# Read your single-video config
with open("config.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

props = json.dumps(config)

# Send the command to Remotion
command = [
    "npx",
    "remotion",
    "render",
    "engine/src/index.js",
    "ProtestVideo",
    "output/final_video.mp4",
    "--props",
    props
]

print(f"--- Rendering: {config['title']} ---")
subprocess.run(command)
print("--- Render Complete! Check the 'output' folder. ---")
Step 5: Run Your Factory
Whenever you are ready to produce a video, simply make sure your terminal is in the Single_Video_System folder and run:

DOS
python render.py
Would you like to run this script right now and confirm that final_video.mp4 appears in your output folder?

You said
Will I need any other packages?

Gemini said
For the exact script we just set up, no. You have absolutely everything you need to render that first foundational video right now.

However, to achieve the specific high-end visuals, voiceover sync, and SVG manipulation you are targeting for your final production pipeline , you will eventually need to add a few targeted packages to your engine.
+2

When you are ready to upgrade to those cinematic features, you will need:


Audio Integration (@remotion/media-utils): This is essential for syncing your animations and scene transitions perfectly to your voiceover tracks.
+1

Advanced Vectors (d3 and lottie-react): d3 gives you professional mathematical control over complex SVG paths (like the elastic connection threads you want to build). lottie-react allows you to import highly complex, pre-rigged animations directly into your code.
+2

You can install all of them at once later by running npm install @remotion/media-utils d3 lottie-react inside your engine folder.
+1

Would you like to run the Python script now to test the base video and confirm the core pipeline is flawless, or shall we install these advanced packages right away?

You said
I have made this structure of the repository, kindly verify it. I want to tell you that I will make the data for the videos scenes by scenes, every scenes will be of 10 seconds, for a total of 2 minutes videos of reels or shorts. For every scenes, the audios will be given in the data. Kindly verify this, and expand and explain for the above plan:

In this version, if I need to make the second video, how will I be able to make it?

Is there any upgradation needed in the above repository structure?

Gemini said
Your repository structure is incredibly solid and professional. You have successfully separated the rendering engine from the automation logic and the data. This is exactly how scalable video factories are built.
+1

However, because you are introducing scene-by-scene audio and need a workflow for generating the second, third, and hundredth video, there are a few necessary upgrades to your structure.

1. The Required Upgrades to Your Structure
Here is your updated repository. Pay attention to the public/ folder and the changes inside the data/ folder.

Why these upgrades matter:
The public/ Folder: Remotion needs a way to read your audio files during the render. Anything placed inside engine/public/ can be accessed natively by Remotion using a simple function called staticFile().

GenericScene.jsx: If every scene is exactly 10 seconds, you do not need to hardcode Scene1.jsx, Scene2.jsx, all the way to Scene12.jsx. You can build one GenericScene.jsx that accepts the animation data and audio path dynamically.


Versioned Data: If you only have one video_config.json, generating the second video means overwriting the data for the first one. By numbering them (video_001.json), you keep a permanent record of every video you ever make.
+1

2. Expanding the Plan: The 10-Second Scene Logic
If you are making a 2-minute (120 seconds) video, and every scene is exactly 10 seconds, you have a strict, highly predictable timeline:

Total Scenes: 12 scenes per video.

Frames per Scene: At 30 FPS, 10 seconds equals exactly 300 frames.

Total Video Length: 3600 frames.

This makes your data/video_001.json incredibly clean to write. Your Python script will feed this JSON into Remotion:

JSON

Inside your SceneManager.jsx, Remotion will map through this array. It will play scene 1 for 300 frames, play video_001_scene_1.mp3, and then instantly switch to scene 2.

3. How to Make the Second Video
When you are ready to produce video #2, your workflow will be completely separated from the React code. You will never touch the engine/ folder.

Step 1: Prep the Audio
Drop your 12 new audio files for the second video into the engine/public/audio/ folder (e.g., video_002_scene_1.mp3).

Step 2: Create the Data
Duplicate video_001.json in your data/ folder and rename it to video_002.json. Change the text, update the audioPath links to point to your new MP3s, and tweak the actions.

Step 3: Run the Python Commander
You will update your automation/render.py script so that it accepts the specific JSON file you want to render. You would open your VS Code terminal and simply type:

DOS
python automation/render.py data/video_002.json
The Python script will read video_002.json, pass it into the Remotion engine , and spit out output/video_002.mp4.

This setup allows you to scale cleanly. Whether it is video 2 or video 200, the process remains exactly the same. Does this 12-scene array structure make sense for the narrative style you are trying to build?
