Title: Why Nothing Ever Changes (Even When Everyone Wants It To)

Everyone says they want change. New rules. Better systems. A different future. But somehow… nothing moves. It’s not because people don’t care. It’s because everyone is connected. Every move… pulls on someone else. So someone has to go first. But going first is dangerous. If you move alone… you pay the price alone. What if you speak up… and nobody joins? What if you change… and everyone else stays comfortable? Now you’re exposed. And here’s the strange part… Everyone is thinking the same thing. They’re waiting. For someone else. Systems don’t resist change. They reward stability. Comfort feels safe. Habit feels normal. And normal is powerful. But something interesting happens… When enough people move at once… The risk spreads. The cost disappears. And suddenly… Change doesn’t feel impossible. It feels inevitable. Nothing changes… until enough people move together.
